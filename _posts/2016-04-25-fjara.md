description: 'Welcome to Fjara Café Bar, Shetland, ZE1. Fjara is locally owned and its main aim is to make customers feel at home. It has something for all parts of the day – from coffee in the morning and sandwiches at lunch right through to cocktails, burgers and more at night. Set on the small peninsula of land jutting out into Brewick bay, Fjara has amazing views for you to enjoy in all weathers and at all times of the day. It is a great wild life spot with plenty of opportunity to spot seals and otters in the surrounding area. With a menu which changes seasonally, Fjara aims to bring different taste and cuisines to Shetland, getting the most from seasonal fruit and vegetables. All our baked goods are freshly made every morning on site, from our fantastic cheese and bacon bloomer to our sweet blueberry pancakes. Open from Monday-Thursday 08:00 - 22:00, Friday-Saturday 08:00 - 00:00, Sunday 10:00 - 22:00. Fjara provides a welcome escape from a hectic day at work, or a place to take the family and relax. Families, food lovers and drink aficionados are all very welcome in Lerwick’s exclusive new cosy spot.'
